# ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore 

Electricity generation in Singapore just over 60 year history as an independent country has consisted almost entirety self generated power from imported oil and gas. It has already once shifted it's electricity generation sector from being almost completely oil based to liquid natural gas based and now faces a new challenge of transitioning to green energy supply.

This decision to generate it's own power has come from deliberate policy to maintain control and resilient power to support itâ€™s growth desires. Looking back at how the generation capacity has grown since early independence can help understand how Singapore as a whole has grown.

## Early days of oil 

***Growing from a few dozen MW of generation capacity to reliable supply***

Following the second world war Singapore went through a tumultuous period to reach independence in 1965. This included transitioning from an unreliable colonial era energy supply where demand rapidly outstripped supply and load shedding was frequent. Pasir Panjang A Power Station, an oil burning steam turbine power station, was commissioned in stages from the 1950s to 1965 to bring on a more reliable load and to supplement  the war-damaged St James Power Station.

Singapore new government identified that continuing to develop generation capacity would be critical to achieving it's industrialisation policies and an additional power station, Pasir Panjang B, was constructed and commissioned in 1965. This nearly doubled the generation capacity of the island and would prove sufficient until the mid 70s.

# ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore

Moving energy around can be categorised in a variety of ways. One way that helps me to understand the challenges we're facing in the energy transition to think of moving energy as electrons through wires or batteries or as a molecules such as oil, natural gas or, if you're an optimistic thinker, hydrogen. If you need to move energy the same, predictable way across land that you control wire and incredibility efficient. But if you are a small island with energy needs that vastly outsize your own generation capacity molecular energy such as coal, oil and gas are the way to go. 

Energy in Singapore just over 60 year history as an independent country has consisted almost entirety of molecule import. It has already once shifted it's electricity generation sector from being almost completely oil based to liquid natural gas based and in doing so create one of the largest LNG trading hubs in the world. But now climate change may force Singapore to strike a balance between  green energy supply and remaining non-reliant on its neighbours.

### Early independence and oil 

Following the second world war through a tumultuous period to reach independence in 1965 Singapore transitioned from an unreliable colonial era energy supply to a more stable, oil-based system. The first project enabling this was the Pasir Panjang A Power Station commissioned in stages from the 1950s to 1965. Pasir Panjang A replaced the war-damaged St James Power Station and rapidly expanded to meet soaring industrial demand. Initially opened in 1953 with 50MW capacity it, along with the adjacent Pasir Panjang B power, station reached a total combined capacity of ~300MW.
